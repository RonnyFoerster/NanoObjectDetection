IMPORTANT:
All the experimental parameters can be found in a json file.
The json datatype is quite strict with the format. The last entry of a key should not end whith a " , " . Booleans are written as 0 and 1.
A path does not accept " \ " instead you have to use " \\ ".

Drift
 
A drift can occur during the measurement. The drift needs to be measured and subtracted from the movement in order to
